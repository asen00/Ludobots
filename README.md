This is a repository for MECH_ENG 495 course taught by Sam Kriegman at Northwestern University during the Winter 2023 quarter. 

The branches are responses to class assignments and build up to a parallel hillclimber which is optimized for locomotion using an evolutionary algorithm. You can watch a video of the final product [here](https://youtu.be/-bC79AYuqt0).

The first half of the assignments were from the [Ludobots course](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/) by Josh Bongard at the University of Vermont. The branches for these are the following.
- simulation
- onelink
- manylinks
- joints
- sensors
- motors
- refactoring
- neurons
- synapses
- randomsearch
- hillclimber
- parallelhc
- quadruped

You can find the end product in the branch called "final."

What I learned: object-oriented programming in Python, parallelization, seeding, pickling
