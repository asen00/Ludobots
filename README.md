# [Artificial Life](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/academics/courses/descriptions/495-artificial-life.html)

Course taught by Sam Kriegman at Northwestern University during the Winter 2023 quarter

The following branches are responses to assignments B-N of the [Ludobots course](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/) by Josh Bongard at the University of Vermont:
- simulation
- onelink
- manylinks
- joints
- sensors
- motors
- refactoring
- neurons
- synapses
- randomsearch
- hillclimber
- parallelhc
- quadruped

The remaining branches are responses to class assignments and build up to the "final" branch. This demonstrates a parallel hillclimber which is optimized for locomotion. You can watch the final product [here](https://youtu.be/-bC79AYuqt0).

What I learned: object-oriented programming in Python, parallelization, evolutionary algorithms, seeding, pickling
